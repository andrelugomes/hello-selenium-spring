Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs with JUnit 5.

`HelloControllerWebMvcTest` makes a call to a very simple service and produces three
documentation snippets.

One showing how to make a request using cURL:


include::{snippets}/hello-controller-web-mvc-test/should-get-a-hello-world-response/curl-request.adoc[]

One showing the HTTP request:

include::{snippets}/hello-controller-web-mvc-test/should-get-a-hello-world-response/http-request.adoc[]

And one showing the HTTP response:

include::{snippets}/hello-controller-web-mvc-test/should-get-a-hello-world-response/http-response.adoc[]
